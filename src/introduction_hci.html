      <p style="margin-left:20px"><h1 style="color:#990000">Human Computer Interactions(HCI)</h1></p>
      
      <p style="font-size:16px; font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align:justify;">HCI is a multidisciplinary field involving inputs from computer science, behavioural sciences and design sciences. It studies the interactions between a human and computer. Interactions between humans and computers happen through interfaces on devices be they physical or virtual. HCI involves hardware and software. The design of physical input devices such as keyboards, mouse, joystick, touch screen, etc as well as graphics on screens are of interest. </p>
      
      <p style="font-size:16px; font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align:justify;">The definition given by the Association of Computing Machinery – ACM states that HCI is "a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them". </p>
      
   <p style="font-size:16px; font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align:justify;">The cost of not considering HCI while designing products has been evident through various accidents attributed to human as well as machine failures such as in aircraft or railways. Research in HCI involves studies of human performance on simulators. Results of such studies are often incorporated into training and safety programs. Researchers of different backgrounds contribute to HCI.</p>
   
   <p style="margin-left:20px"><h1 style="color:#990000">Usability Engineering (UE)</h1></p>   
   
   <p style="font-size:16px; font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align:justify;">Usability Engineering is concerned with HCI and specifically with conceptualising, designing, constructing and prototyping interfaces as in software and as in hardware (products). Achieving highest possible user satisfaction in the use of the product is the prime aim.  Human beings and their limitations both cognitive as well as physical are researched and engineered into the designs. Graphical user interface, gestural and sound interfaces; vision and perceptual interfaces, brain and thought operated interactions are some of the areas on which usability engineers work upon. Usability engineering inputs come from cognitive sciences and engineering sciences as well as computer sciences.  Usability engineers are both creative designers as well as engineers building products.</p>
   
 <p style="font-size:16px; font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align:justify;">Usability Engineering is new and emerging academic area of specialisations   and incorporates in its fold sub areas in Creative Design such as interaction design (ID), user experience design (UXD) and user centred design (UCD).  The usability engineering lab at the Department of Design at IITG is one such pioneering laboratory  (established in 2003)  in India that imparts education and training to designers and researchers since its founding in 2002. Other design schools and computer technology institutions have followed suit by establishing educational programs in HCI & Interaction Design.</p>
